	<p>
	 I'm a fullstack developer from üá¶üá∑, currently traveling the world
	 so I'm not fixed on a particular place.
	 I graduated as a Systems Engineer at the Universidad Tecnologica Nacional university.

   >
		LenioLabs
	 </a>.
	
 My daily tasks are frontend development and AI research.
	</p>

	<p>
	 I'm passionate about technology, playing with new tools and 
	 open source. I created several projects that were born out of my 
	 curiosity and eagerness to learn. I use nvim as my main IDE ‚ù§Ô∏è
	</p>
	<p>

	 My skills include frontend and backend software development, so I can build
	 anything basically from scratch and if I can not, I will learn how to.
	 I'm continually trying to be a better engineer to build stuffs that matter.
	 I also love animals, playing the guitar and being outdoorsüèîÔ∏èüèñÔ∏è
